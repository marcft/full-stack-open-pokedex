# CI/CD Pipeline for a Python Application

We have an application being developed by a team of six people, programmed in Python. To maximize our development time and reduce deployment issues, we need to incorporate a CI setup.

CI is essential because it ensures that code changes are automatically tested and validated before being merged into the main branch, reducing the chances of introducing bugs into the main codebase. Additionally, CI automates repetitive tasks such as testing and building, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than manually handling deployments or debugging integration issues.

We have been researching tools for the common steps in a CI pipeline. For linting, we have chosen Pylint, it checks for errors and enforces a consistent coding standard for everyone in the team. For testing, we selected Pytest because it provides an easy-to-understand framework for writing unit tests. For building our project, we are using setuptools to package and distribute our application.

For our CI environment, we have chosen GitLab CI/CD. GitLab CI/CD is a robust platform that integrates with our repository and supports different kind of workflows. Given our medium-sized project, we believe a cloud-based environment is the best for us. This choice saves us the time and effort required to configure and maintain our own server, and in our case, a cloud-based solution could be even cheaper.

Overall, this setup not only ensures code quality and reliability but also increases the speed of our deployment process, allowing our team to focus on developing features rather than managing infrastructure.
